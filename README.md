# Land cover classification and crops identification using satellite images  
<b>Land cover classification and crops identification constitute an important economic part of many countries in the world, is one of the most commonly performed tasks in agro-environmental and geospatial research, whose domain ranges from physical geographic observations (i.e. information on the land/crop type, land/crop area, configuration of buildings, roads, identifying surface water bodies, etc.) to environmental planning. Land cover classification has become a powerful tool in explaining relationships between environmental changes to socio-economic activities. The recent advances in high-end computer programming and the availability of free satellite imageries have brought data science and remote sensing in the same platform. It is now possible to quickly perform land cover and crop classifications over a wider spatio-temporal spectrum using simplified machine learning or deep learning algorithms.</b>
